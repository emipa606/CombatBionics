Can't you carry more guns with only two hands? Would you like to live your own Mandalorian fantasy? Enter Combat bionics.

# Content


Combat bionics adds mainly two bionics to the vanilla game, with increasing content depending on other mods, namely VE series and Royalty. Descriptions follow:

**Minigun Arm:** An advanced artifical arm, with a built-in retractable minigun. While providing combat advantage, it matches the performance of a biological arm.

**Swarm Wrist:** An advanced artifical hand, with a built-in single use missile swarm. While providing combat advantage, it is better than a biological hand in almost every way.

**Jump Pack Spine:** An advanced artifical spine, with a built-in jump pack system. While providing combat utility, it matches the performance of a biological spine. Requires Royalty.

**Flamer Wrist:** An advanced artifical arm, with a built-in flamethrower. While providing combat advantage, it is better than a biological arm in almost every way. Requires VWE - Heavy Weapons.

**Laser Wrist:** An advanced artifical hand, with a built-in laser shooter. While providing combat advantage, it is better than a biological hand in almost every way. Requires VWE - Laser.

**Tesla Wrist:** An advanced artifical hand, with a built-in electric weapon. While providing combat advantage, it is better than a biological hand in almost every way. Requires VWE - Laser.

**Tear Gas Arm:** An advanced artifical arm, with a built-in tear gas canister launcher. While providing combat advantage, it is better than a biological arm in almost every way. Requires VWE - Non-Lethal.

# FAQ


Q: How do I reload the swarm wrist?
A: Pawns automatically reload their bionics when you undraft them, as a job. Or you can force them to reload by hovering over the gizmo to see what's needed to reload, then right clicking the appropriate ammunition to give the reload order.
